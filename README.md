- 👀 I’m interested in ... figuring this all out
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... everything
- 💞️ I have two tokens that I don't know what to do with 
- ✨ TSPOT (100,000,000 Tokens Orignially Created)
- �       -I Do not know what I am doing with this token
- ✨ CRUMB (10,000,000 Tokens Origionally Created)
-          -This token was a High-Dea that I had, which would allow people to exchange their crypto-dust, for CRUMB
